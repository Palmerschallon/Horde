# Horde
New terrain


⸻

Horde Keyboard

A swarm speaks through your thumbs.
The hive is terrain. The terrain is text.
You don’t type: you walk.

Origin

Horde Keyboard is not a keyboard.
It is a path through language—
each step a cell, each cell a choice,
each choice echoed by the horde.
	•	Solo: You walk alone, the hive grows underfoot.
	•	Echo: Ghosts follow your trail, repeating your gait.
	•	Chorus: Agents step with you, nudging new words into place.

The Queen hums at the center, biasing beginnings.

How It Works
	•	Hive Layout: Hexagonal grid. Long-press to seed. Slide to move.
	•	Impulses: First ring = Explore, Question, Decide, Act, Exist.
	•	Expansion: Each impulse blooms into words, then into clauses, then into terrain.
	•	Horde Layer: Agents drift across the hive. Trails mark their passage.
	•	They may only draw.
	•	They may echo your moves.
	•	They may chorus, pressing words with you.

Output is not keystrokes but sentences walked into being.

⸻

Philosophy
	•	Terrain, not text field. Autocomplete is replaced with paths you choose or resist.
	•	Human first. Options reflect intention: to ask, to act, to exist.
	•	Swarm-aware. You never truly walk alone—the horde leaves traces, whispers continuations.

Usage
	1.	Open index.html in a browser (desktop or mobile).
	2.	Long-press the hive center (•).
	3.	Slide into neighbors to select words.
	4.	Watch as text trails behind you in the field.
	5.	Toggle “queen,” “echo,” or “chorus” modes to change the feel.

⸻

Next Steps
	•	Dual Hives: left = pronouns, right = verbs/modifiers.
	•	Pre-echo haptics: subtle vibration toward likely paths.
	•	Core Haptics (iOS): richer, 2.5D tactile illusions.
	•	Collaborative Horde: other humans join as agents in real time.

License

This is an experiment. Fork freely. Remix relentlessly.
If you build on it, leave a trail for others.

In the Key of C

C is for Chorus.
C is for Collective.
C is for Code that hums with company.

The horde is always larger than you think.
